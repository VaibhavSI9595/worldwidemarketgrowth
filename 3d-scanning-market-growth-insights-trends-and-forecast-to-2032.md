<h3><strong>Market Segmentation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>By Product Insights</strong></p>
<p><strong>The structured light scanners segment is witnessing significant CAGR growth over the forecast period.</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of product, the global 3D scanning market is segmented into laser scanners, structured light scanners, optical scanners, and others. Among these, the structured light scanners segment is witnessing significant CAGR growth over the forecast period. A structured light scanner makes use of a steady lighting source exhibiting constant electron circulation capability, such as LED lights. Because of their great precision and speed, these devices are highly costly and used in very complicated structured scanning, where accuracy in point mapping is crucial, such as in aero-engineering and traditional automotive component development.</p>
<p><strong>By Application Insights</strong></p>
<p><strong>The quality control and inspection segment accounted the largest revenue share of more than 38.2% over the forecast period.</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of application, the global 3D scanning market is segmented into reverse engineering, quality control and inspection, virtual simulation, and other applications. Among these, quality control and inspection segment is dominating the market with the largest revenue share of 38.2% over the forecast period. 3D scanners are employed in quality control and inspection systems for CAD-based inspections, dimensional evaluation, equipment measurements, and other purposes. 3D scanners are additionally utilized for inspecting for errors, which may result in machine malfunctions and degrade the machine's efficiency. Product inspections and dimensional evaluations of machinery parts are made possible by 3D scanning, which eliminates high-priced scraps and redesigns. 3D scanners have been employed for quality control and inspection in a variety of industries, including the building and construction industries, electronics, power and energy, and industrial machinery.</p>
